<h1> Hello World!</h1>
<p1> My name is Caleb Sedore and I am from Pulaski, New York. I am a sophmore at Lehigh University and a Journalism Major, along with a member of the basketball team. Although basketball is my passion I enjoy all things involving sports, whether it's playing, watching, or learning you can always find me interacting with sports. Outside of traditional sports, my favorite hobby is freshwater fishing, mainly for largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and northern pike.

<p1> This comic is a quick introduction into who I am, one of the assignments we did in my data visualization class.
