<h1> Hello World!</h1>
<p1> My name is Caleb Sedore and I am from Pulaski, New York. I am a sophmore at Lehigh University and a Journalism Major, along with a member of the basketball team. Although basketball is my passion I enjoy all things involving sports, whether it's playing, watching, or learning you can always find me interacting with sports. Outside of traditional sports, my favorite hobby is freshwater fishing, mainly for largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and northern pike.

<h2> Patriot League Basketball</h2>
<p1>As a basketball player for Lehigh, who competes in the Patriot League, I was interested in looking in at some of the important offensive and defensive statistics from across the league. After learning how to use Tableau in class, I put together a worksheet comparing different teams statistics from the 2016-17 season. Check out the worksheet in the link below.</p1>
